I guess a lot of this will end up back in entities - but it may be that genetics stays its own module.

Anyway, genemap format:
    a pair of structures:
        dictionary indexed by stat keys, containing tuples with (chromosome, gene) indices
        list of chromosomes, each is a:
            list of genes, each of which has as its value a stat key

Statlist format:
    a dict, indexed by stat keys:
        pairs of [dominance, value]
